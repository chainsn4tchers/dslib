# dslib
library of some advanced and efficient data structures that I find useful for competitive coding sometimes. Decided to implement them in a proper fashion. Compiled and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

ps - few files have an accompanying ```_lt``` version, which have been created keeping performance and speed in mind. It is upto the user to make sure the operations/computations performed on them are legal (bounds checking, overflows, etc.).
